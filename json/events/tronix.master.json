The event gives an insight into how wireless communication systems work and the complexity of antenna design. \nThe event requires the participants to build a directional antenna to receive the messages. The received signals are decoded by modifying an FM receiver to match the transmitting frequency. The direction of reception can be determined by adjusting the antenna and the position of the transmitter can be deciphered by triangulation. The goal is to find the fox at the earliest along with decoding the message being transmitted. \nA workshop will be conducted on the day of the event to help the participants build the antenna and modify the receiver.","subimage":""}],"list":{"title":"","items":[""]},"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}]},{"name":"Trade Off","link":"tradeoff","banner":"tradeoff.svg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"","subdescription":"Trade-off is a fun-filled fiercely competitive circuit design competition that makes students come up with efficient, out of the box solutions to engineering problems through circuitry.
